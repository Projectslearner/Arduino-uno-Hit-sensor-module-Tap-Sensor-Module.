\### Tap Sensor Module with Shock Detection

#### Project Overview

This project utilizes a tap sensor module to detect shocks or taps and provides visual feedback using an LED indicator. When a shock is detected, the LED flashes, and the count of shocks is displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Tap Sensor Module**
3. **LED**
4. **Resistor (if required for LED)**
5. **Breadboard**
6. **Jumper Wires**

#### Circuit Wiring

1. **Tap Sensor Module:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the tap sensor module to digital pin 3 on the Arduino.

2. **LED:**
   - Connect the anode (longer leg) of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino.
   - Connect the cathode (shorter leg) of the LED to the ground (GND) pin on the Arduino through a current-limiting resistor (if necessary).

#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Assemble the circuit according to the wiring instructions.
   - Ensure all connections are secure and components are correctly placed on the breadboard.

2. **Observe the Sensor Readings:**
   - When a shock is detected, the LED will flash, indicating the shock.
   - The count of shocks will be displayed on the Serial Monitor.

#### Applications

- **Shock Detection:** Use the tap sensor module for detecting shocks or taps in various applications.
- **Activity Monitoring:** Monitor and count activities such as taps or impacts.
- **Security Systems:** Implement in security systems to detect physical disturbances or impacts.
